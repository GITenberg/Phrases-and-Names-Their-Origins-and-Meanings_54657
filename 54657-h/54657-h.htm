</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Few words are necessary to introduce this work to the reader.
It partakes of the nature of an encyclopædia, with the saving
clause that the information it sets forth is confined to a plain
statement of facts.  Verbal embellishments have been studiously
avoided. Those who seek for additional intelligence may easily
obtain it from ordinarily available sources. To account for the
origin of popular phrases and names has been the author’s sole
design. To the best of his knowledge, no other work of the kind
exists. From the stores of his own knowledge, acquired through
many years of omnivorous reading, patient inquiry, and investigation,
he has been enabled to bring together an</em> <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Olla podrida</span>
<em>which should go far towards supplying a want</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>The origin of place-names is interesting in that it opens up the
history of peoples and the civilising influences, if so one might
term it, of conquest. London street-names, in particular, convey
in one word to a person of antiquarian tastes as much meaning
as “a volume of forgotten lore.” As to phrases and expressions,
the author has made a special study of the subject. A
great many Americanisms have been included, but as the
number is daily increasing it would require a monthly publication
of such home-made phrases to keep fully abreast with the
times. That nothing should be wanting in the way of exhaustiveness,
it has been thought advisable to incorporate in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>text a number of slang terms and expressions which daily assail
one’s ears. To the author the compilation of this volume has
been a pleasant recreation in the intervals of more exacting
literary labours. If it be found to contain a plethora of good
things, the reader will, of course, take them out in small
doses.</em></p>

<p class='c010'><b>Acknowledge the Corn.</b> An Americanism of extremely
popular application. Its origin is thus given by <cite>The
Pittsburg Commercial Advertiser</cite>: “Some years ago a
raw customer from the upper country determined to
try his fortune at New Orleans. Accordingly he provided
himself with two flat boats--one laden with corn
and the other with potatoes--and down the river he
went. The night after his arrival he went up town to
a gambling-house. Of course, he commenced betting,
and, his luck proving unfortunate, he lost. When his
money was gone he bet his ‘truck’; and the corn and
potatoes followed the money. At last, when evidently
cleaned out, he returned to his boats at the wharf,
where the evidences of a new misfortune presented
themselves. Through some accident or other the flat
boat containing the corn was sunk, and a total loss.
Consoling himself as well as he could he went to sleep,
dreaming of gamblers, potatoes, and corn. It was
scarcely sunrise, however, when he was disturbed by
the ‘child of chance,’ who had arrived to take possession
of the two boats as his winnings. Slowly awakening
from his sleep, our hero, rubbing his eyes and
looking the man in the face, replied: ‘Stranger, I
acknowledge the corn--take ’em; but the potatoes you
<em>can’t</em> have, by thunder!’ Since that time it has become
customary for a man who frankly admits having
been hoaxed or beaten to say: ‘I acknowledge the
corn.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Actors’ Day.</b> A day--the third Thursday in October--set
apart for a performance in all the theatres of the
United Kingdom in aid of the various theatrical
charities--actors being pledged to give their services,
dramatic authors to forego their fees, and managers to
devote the entire receipts to the good cause.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Addled Parliament.</b> A memorable session during the

have discovered the great Western Continent. A

to have been written by Vespucci, found its way into
the hands of Martin Waldseemuller of Freiburg, Baden.
This he translated, and caused it to be published by a
bookseller at St Die in Lorraine in 1507. In his
preface to the work Waldseemuller suggested that the

<p class='c010'><b>April Fool.</b> The custom of April Fooling originated in
France, which country took the lead in shifting the
New Year from what is now Lady Day to the 1st of
January. This occurred in 1564. From the earliest
periods of history people bestowed gifts upon their
neighbours at the New Year, but as the 25th of March
so often fell in Holy Week, even on Good Friday
itself, the Church uniformly postponed the celebration
of the New Year until the octave--viz. the 1st
of April. When, therefore, New Year’s Day had been
transferred to the 1st of January, people paid mock
visits to their friends on the 1st of April with the
object of fooling them into the belief that matters
remained as they were. The like custom was introduced
into England on the alteration of our calendar
in 1762. April Fools’ Day is supposed to be over at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>twelve o’clock, since the New Year’s visitation and

Duke. Finding they could not bear against the

negress of powerful build and strength, named Maria
Lee, kept a sailor’s lodging-house at Boston. Everyone
dreaded her, and she so frequently assisted the police
of that day to pin down a refractory prisoner before he
could be manacled that “Send for Black Maria!”

Hence the earliest vehicles for the conveyance of
offenders against law and order, especially since they

Cormack Macarthy was besieged by the English in
Blarney Castle in 1662 he concluded an armistice, with
the object of surrendering after a few days; but instead

most reverential sense, relative to the Blood of Christ--<em>e.g.</em>
the “Bloody Sacrifice of the Mass.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Bloody Assizes.</b> Those held by Judge Jeffreys in 1685 for

<p class='c010'><b>Blue Hen’s Chickens.</b> A nickname for the people of
Delaware. <em>The Delaware State Journal</em> thus accounts
for its origin: “At the beginning of the Revolutionary
War there lived in Sussex county of that colony a
gentleman of fortune named Caldwell, who was a
sportsman, and breeder of fine horses and game-cocks.
His favourite axiom was that the character of the
progeny depends more on the mother than on the
father, and that the finest game-cocks depended on
the hen rather than on the cock. His observation led
him to select a <em>blue</em> hen, and he never failed to hatch
a good game-cock from a blue hen’s egg. Caldwell
distinguished himself as an officer in the First <a id='corr37.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Deleware'>Delaware</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_37.27'><ins class='correction' title='Deleware'>Delaware</ins></a></span>
Regiment for his daring spirit. The high state
of its discipline was conceded to its exertions, so that
when officers were sent on recruiting service it was
said that they had gone home for more of Caldwell’s
game-cocks; but as Caldwell insisted that no cock
could be truly game unless its mother was a <em>blue</em> hen,
the expression <em>Blue Hen’s Chickens</em> was substituted for
game-cocks.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Blue Stocking.</b> From the famous club of literary ladies
formed by Mrs Montague in 1840, at which Benjamin
Stillingfleet, who habitually wore blue stockings, was
a regular visitor. Blue stockings, therefore, became the

as far back as 1400, called <em>Della Calza</em>, from the colour
of stockings worn.</p>

a very corrupt individual, who twenty years ago or
more did a tremendous business in the way of supplying
the great west, and portions of the south-west,
with counterfeit bills and bills on fictitious banks.
The western people fell into the habit of shortening
the name of Borghese to that of <em>Bogus</em>, and his bills,
as well as all others of like character, were universally
styled by them ‘bogus currency.’” So that the word
is really American.</p>

his successors, immediately after saying grace at meals.</p>

St Katherine Cree, Leadenhall Street, inaugurated by
the rector, the Rev. Dr Whittemore, in 1853. The

brings a bouquet. The idea of the flower
service, if not the sermon, has been largely copied in
various parts of the country.</p>

gave the name of Lord Foppington to a conceited
coxcomb in this comedy “The Relapse,” 1697.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Forecastle.</b> The quarters apportioned to the seamen in the

<p class='c010'><b>France.</b> Anciently <em>Franconia</em>, the country of the Franks,
so called from the <em>franca</em>, a kind of javelin with which
they armed themselves when this people effected the
conquest of Gaul.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='FRANCISCANS'></a><b>Franciscans.</b> Friars of the Order of St Francis of Assisi.
Originally the Grey Friars, their habits are now brown.
One of the rules laid down by their pious founder was
that the brethren should always be clad like the poorest
of the poor. He selected the loose sack of grey, undyed
wool, bound round the waist by a cord of the Umbrian
Shepherds. Towards the close of the fifteenth century
the better classes affected gaudy colours, and the
poorer orders, imitating them so far as the use of dyed
materials was concerned, took to wearing garments of
sober brown. Hence the change in the colour of the
Franciscan habit.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Frankincense.</b> Incense brought to the East from “Franconia.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Freak Dinner.</b> A latter-day term, arising out of the

<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>There have been dinners costing £100 per head. To
please the eye, champagne has been made to flow
wastefully from a fountain. The name is, however,
more correctly applied to the scenic embellishments,
as when the banqueting-chamber of the Gaiety
Restaurant was converted into a South African mining
tent, and real Kaffirs were the waiters, to remind the
diners of the mode by which they had acquired their
wealth.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Free Church of Scotland.</b> The adherents of Dr Chalmers,
who separated from the Scottish Presbyterian Church

1843.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Free House.</b> A public-house, of which the landlord, being
his own master, is at full liberty to change his brewer
if the quality of the liquor supplied to him does not
give complete satisfaction. See “<a href='#TIEDHOUSE'>Tied House</a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Free-lance.</b> An unattached journalist who sends out his
literary wares on approval. The term has been derived
from those roving companies of knights who, at the
close of the Wars of the Crusades, were ready to enlist
under any banner for a monetary consideration. Like
the mercenaries of the Carthaginians and Romans,
these were the first paid soldiers.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Free List.</b> A list kept by theatrical managers of Men
about Town, barristers, medical men, and others, who
can be relied upon to “dress the house” at short
notice when business is bad, and so give it an air of
prosperity. These are not “Deadheads” in the
ordinary sense, because they render the management a
service; but being well able to pay for seats at all
times they are apt to be obnoxious in their demands
when the entertainment really draws good houses.
Hence the notice “Free list entirely suspended” at
such times.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Freemasons.</b> A brotherhood of masons who in the
Mediæval Ages built the cathedrals which are even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>now lasting mementoes of their skill. They travelled
from one city to another, always employed in the
same devoted work, and, to prove that they were
master craftsmen, invented various symbols, by which
they could be recognised. Everywhere these masons
enjoyed immunity from taxation and military service.
Hence they received the name of “free-masons.”</p>

of the Dominicans or Black Friars anciently located

<p class='c010'><b>From Pillar to Post.</b> This had reference in olden times to

took place by night.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Furnival Street.</b> A name left to remind us of Furnival’s
Inn, on the opposite side of Holborn, and where

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span><b>Gag.</b> An actor’s interpolation of catch phrases at his own
sweet will. Originally, however, <em>gagging</em> was a device
to disconcert or stop the mouth of another actor by
the unexpected employment of words not in the text

<p class='c010'><b>Gallivanting.</b> An old English word for “doing the agreeable.”
Its derivation is clearly traceable to “gallant”
and “gallantry.”</p>

shoe.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Galvanism.</b> After Luigi Galvani, the eminent physician of

he little expected.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='GAVEHIM'></a><b>Gave him a Roland for an Oliver.</b> Exactly what he gave
me himself; a tit for tat. Roland and Oliver were
two knights in the train of Charlemagne. Both were
equally accomplished; what the one did the other
essayed also with success. In the matter of fighting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>too they were exactly on a par, since, after having
been put to the test in single combat, for a long time
neither of them gained the least advantage.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Gave him the Cold Shoulder.</b> Received him with scant
ceremony. The allusion is to the fare generally set

indeed, it is said that some Kentish lands are still held
by this ancient tenure.</p>

England. After the Hanoverian Succession, by which
time pictorial signs had for the most part disappeared,
and the name alone stood for a sign, the omission of
the “St” made the sign complimentary to the reigning
monarch. Reading of the execution of Charles I., we
are told that the ill-fated King handed his “George”
to Juxon, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who attended
him on the scaffold. This was the badge of the Order
of the Garter, representing St George on horseback
piercing the fallen dragon with his lance.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>George and Dragon.</b> See “<a href='#GEORGE'>George</a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Georges Sand.</b> This literary pseudonym of Mademoiselle

<p class='c010'><b>Gerrymandering.</b> An American political term for subdividing
a constituency in such a way as to give one
party an unfair advantage over all others. Its adoption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>was due to Elbridge Gerry, Governor of Massachusetts.
When a map of this new electoral distribution was
shown to an artist he remarked that it looked very
much like a salamander. “A salamander, you say?
Why not a Gerrymander!” was the reply. And a
Gerrymander the name of the scheme remained.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Get there all the same.</b> An Americanism meaning to
succeed in any enterprise, despite all obstacles or
opposition.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ghost.</b> One employed by an author or an artist to do his
work for him, so called because, his name and personality
being withheld from the public, he is kept in

to the friend who had inspired or suggested the work.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='GHOSTWALKING'></a><b>Ghost walking.</b> A theatrical phrase. Actors assembling
at the theatre for their weekly salaries generally put
the question among themselves: “Is the ghost walking?”
While those about to accept an engagement
with a manager of whom they know nothing ask:
“Does the ghost walk?” Its origin is as follows:--Many
years ago a manager of the Bogus type had in
his company a self-willed actor whose strong part was
the Ghost in “Hamlet.” If his salary was not forthcoming
on a Saturday morning he exclaimed: “Then
the ghost won’t walk to-night.” Indispensable actor
as he was, the manager invariably acceded to his
demands. Sometimes it happened that he received
only a portion of his salary, with a promise of the
remainder in the course of the performance, in which
case he refused to go on until the money was actually
paid. It is said that the other members of the
company would wait on a Saturday morning about the
time for “Treasury” until they received word by a
messenger that the ghost <em>would</em> walk.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Giaour.</b> From the Arabic <em>kiafir</em>, “unbeliever.” The Turks
bestow this name on all European Christians, enemies
of the Mohammedan faith. Readers of Lord Byron’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>poem “The Giaour” may require to be informed of
its meaning.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Gibberish.</b> After Geber, an Arabian alchemist of the
eleventh century, who employed an unintelligible

a Moorish General, to whose prowess the conquest of
Spain in the eighth century was due.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Gibraltar of America.</b> The city of Quebec, from its commanding
and impregnable position on the heights.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Gibson Girl.</b> A new type of womanhood popularised in

<p class='c010'><b>Gone to the Devil.</b> From the twofold circumstance that
money lost through lawyers would surely be spent by

“gone to the ‘Devil.’”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Gone to the Dogs.</b> Money that has been squandered

or any person or thing likely to pass muster
for the reality. This originated during the Anti-Masonic
riots in the state of New York, when it was
alleged that the Freemasons had drowned a man called
Morgan for having betrayed their secrets. A body
was actually found in the river <a id='corr117.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='near near'>near</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_117.13'><ins class='correction' title='near near'>near</ins></a></span> Fort Niagara,
and identified by Morgan’s wife chiefly on account
of a missing tooth. It was, however, proved that
the whole story had been trumped up for political
ends. A prominent politician who had a hand in the
affair indeed confessed that, when reminded that the
body would never pass for Morgan’s, he declared: “It’s
a good enough Morgan.” Hence the phrase.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Goodge Street.</b> After the name of the builder.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>was sold, the ivy being sacred to Bacchus. Travellers

needed no bush to direct them when next they visited
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Goodwin Sands.</b> At the time of the Norman Conquest

gave it this name in his “Salmagundi.” Its people in
his time were anything but fools, yet he may not have

By referring to the city as Gotham he made a playful

a town whose inhabitants did and said the most foolish
things.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Go to Jericho.</b> Jericho was the name given by Henry VIII.
to the Manor of Blackmore, near Chelmsford, whither
he often retired quite suddenly from affairs of State.
At such times his courtiers suspected some fresh freak
of gallantry, and said he had “gone to Jericho.” Moreover,
when in a testy mood, his Queen would tell him
to “go to Jericho!”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Go to Putney.</b> A very old expression, tantamount to consigning
a person beyond the pale of London society or
civilisation.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Got out of Bed the wrong Way.</b> From the old superstition
that planting the left foot on the ground first
on rising in the morning was a harbinger of ill luck

to the erection of a new St Benet’s in the Mile
End Road.</p>

introduced when French was the language of the

Granby, whose name is also perpetuated by many a
tavern sign.</p>

Grand Theatre, the Grand Tour, and the Grand Canal
at Venice.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Grand Old Man.</b> The name applied by Mr Labouchere to
Mr W. E. Gladstone on the occasion of Mr Bradlaugh’s

The corruption came about quite easily.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hearse.</b> From the French <em>herse</em> and German <em>hirsch</em>. Both
these terms expressed a harrow or triangular candlestick
set at the head of a coffin at a funeral service in
church. At a later period they implied a sepulchral
mound temporarily distinguished by a triangular stake
setting forth a number or other identification mark.
The modern application of the term to a vehicle specially
designed for the conveyance of a body to the grave
was an easy transition.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Heart-breakers.</b> Artificial ringlets formerly worn by ladies
to enhance their beauty. It is said that the most inveterate
woman-hater was not proof against the attraction
of these Heart-breakers.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Heathen.</b> Literally a dweller on a heath in the open
country. The Romans applied the term to those who,
having no communion with the dwellers in cities, were
cut off from all knowledge of their complicated system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>of mythology. When Rome became converted to
Christianity the untutored inhabitants of the country
at large were the last to receive the Gospel. A heathen
nation therefore, in a religious sense, is one far removed
from civilisation, which offers a fruitful field for
missionary work.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Heaven-sent Minister.</b> William Pitt, first Earl of Chatham,
one of the most eminent statesmen that England has
ever possessed. His intense love of his own country
prompted him to measures which made the success of
British arms pre-eminent. Had his colleagues during
the later portion of his career been actuated by the
same patriotism as himself, and heeded his warnings,
our American colonies might never have separated
from the Mother Country.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Heavy Hill.</b> Holborn Hill, because the hearts of those
riding in the fatal cart to the place of execution at
Tyburn were heavily laden.</p>
<p class='c010'><b>“He” Bible.</b> The first edition of the Authorised Version,

became known as “The ‘She’ Bible.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hebrews.</b> Said to be descendants of Eber, the great-grandson
of Shem, one of the ancestors of Abraham.
The greater probability, however, is that the term has
been derived from the native <em>ebher</em>, the region on the
other side--<em>i.e.</em> of the Euphrates.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hebrides.</b> Expresses the “Western Isles” of the Norwegians.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hector.</b> To swagger, bully, treat with insolence, after
Hector, the celebrated Trojan warrior. From the
known character of this hero of antiquity it is not easy
to conceive that he could ever have been a braggart.
The inference is rather that this word in its accepted
sense was derived from the brutal manner in which
Achilles treated the body of Hector after he had
slain him in single combat.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span><b>Hedge Priest.</b> Specifically in Ireland an itinerant cleric

the reigning monarch.</p>

no child in the direct line of succession is born
to supersede his claim.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Heligoland.</b> Danish for “Holy Land,” which name was
bestowed upon it after the conversion of its people
by St Willibrod in the seventh century. A great many
conventual establishments sprang up on the soil, but
the encroachments of the sea had swept them away by
the seventeenth century. Prior to their conversion
the <em>Anglii</em> were wont to repair to this isle from the
opposite mainland for the worship of the goddess
Hertha, also known as Foseta, of whose temple it is
said some ruins yet remain.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='HELIOTROPE'></a><b>Heliotrope.</b> From the Greek <em>helios</em>, sun, and <em>tropos</em>, to turn.

by the Romans traditionally ascribed to Hercules.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hereford.</b> Expresses the Saxon for “army ford” over the
River Wye. During the Heptarchy this was the military
headquarters of Mercia.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Heroic Verse.</b> That usually selected for epic poetry, since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>the exploits of Achilles at the siege of Troy were set
forth by Homer in hexameters.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hertford.</b> Originally “Hartford,” being the ford of the
River Lea crossed by harts.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='HESABRICK'></a><b>He’s a Brick.</b> This expression, if not quite as old as the
hills, carries us back to the time of Plutarch, who in
his “Lives” gives the following account of its origin:--“On
a certain occasion, an ambassador from Epirus
paid a visit to Argesilaus, King of Sparta, on a mission
of diplomatic importance. By that monarch he was
shown over the capital. But the ambassador failed to
see any massive walls reared to defend the city, and
openly expressed his astonishment to the King. ‘Sire!’
he said, ‘I have visited most of your principal towns,
and find no walls reared for defence. Why is this?’
‘Indeed, Sir Ambassador,’ Argesilaus replied, ‘thou
canst not have looked carefully. Come with me to-morrow,
and I will show thee the walls of Sparta.’ On
the following morning the King conducted his guest
out upon the plains, where his army was drawn up
in full battle array, and, proudly pointing to the serried
host, he exclaimed: ‘There, Sir Ambassador, thou
beholdest the walls of Sparta--ten thousand men, and
every man a brick!’”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>He’s joined the Majority.</b> See “<a href='#GONEOVER'>Gone over to the Majority</a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hessel Street.</b> The recent change from Morgan Street to
Hessel Street in Stepney is accounted for by the
discovery that here a celebrated character, in the
person of Ph&oelig;be Hessel, was born. For many years
she served as a private soldier in the Fifth Regiment of
Foot, and fought at the Battle of Fontenoy, in which
engagement she was wounded. A long inscription on
her tombstone in Brighton churchyard would have us
believe that she was at the time of her death, 21st
December 1821, no less than one hundred and eight
years of age.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hessian.</b> An Americanism for a hireling, a fighter for pay,

the Knights of St John of Jerusalem in Clerkenwell.
In 1271 they built a priory here, of which the barn
remained standing until modern days. Compared with
the low-lying district round about, this was elevated
ground.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Highbury Barn.</b> Originally a cake and ale house contiguous
to the ancient barn of the Clerkenwell Priory.
This place of public resort developed into a theatre in
1865; subsequently it degenerated into a dancing
saloon, and was finally abolished in 1875.</p>

word originated in the western states of North
America.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Highgate.</b> The village that sprang up around the ancient

tolls levied here were for the benefit of the Bishop
of London. Even in our time this elevated situation

on all travellers passing through the gate.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='HIGHTIME'></a><b>High Time.</b> A phrase employed in the same sense as High

Hobson kept a livery stable at Cambridge. When the

England, in commemoration for the final expulsion
of the Danes, who had ravaged the eastern portions
of our country for more than two centuries. This
occurred on Easter Tuesday 1074. Most of the
Danes were slaughtered off-hand by first hamstringing,
or cutting their hams or houghs, which prevented
them from making for their boats; hence the term
<em>Hock</em> for the festival. The English landlords levied
what was called “Hock Money” on this day from
their tenants, in return for which they treated them to
a good supper. In modern times people stopped
pedestrians in the streets with ropes, and declined to
release them until they had parted with hock money.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hocus-pocus.</b> The gibberish of a conjurer when performing
his tricks; said to have been derived from one Ochus
Bochus, a celebrated wizard of Northern Europe, three
centuries ago. The early conjurers were thought to use

our sleight-of-hand professors dispense with words,
and fire off a pistol, doubtless to prove that they can
do the trick in a crack.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='HOLDHARD'></a><b>Hold hard.</b> This exclamation, when the advice really
means to stop or “leave go,” sounds ridiculous. It

of an Irish jaunting car lest the rider might be thrown
out of it.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hole in the Wall.</b> A tavern sign, derived from the fact

trances, foretold events, and afterwards entered a

against the divorce of Queen Catherine of Aragon,
she, in company with five monks, was hanged at
Tyburn.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Holyrood Palace.</b> This residence of the ancient kings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Scotland grew out of the Abbey of the Holy Rood
built by David I. as the permanent abode of the
Black Rood, brought to Scotland by St Margaret in
1070. This precious relic was a piece of the true
cross set in gold and ebony. It fell into the hands
of the English at the battle of Neville’s Cross in 1344,

<p class='c010'><b>Honduras.</b> Spanish for “deep water.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Honey Lane.</b> In this lane stood an ancient market-house
or hall for the sale of honey. Owing to the dearness
of sugar prior to the discovery of America and the
colonisation of the West Indies, honey was in general
request.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Honeymoon.</b> From the custom of the Scandinavians, who

<p class='c010'><b>Hoodlum.</b> A street rough, originally a product of San
Francisco, but now common in New York and most
cities of the American Union. The origin of the term
was thus accounted for by <em>The Congregationalist</em>,
26th September 1877: “A newspaper man in San
Francisco, in attempting to coin a word to designate a
gang of young street Arabs under the beck of one
named ‘Muldoon,’ hit upon the idea of dubbing them
<em>Noodlums</em>--that is, simply reversing the leader’s name.
In writing the word the strokes of the <em>N</em> did not
correspond in height, and the compositor, taking the
<em>N</em> for an <em>H</em>, printed it <em>Hoodlum</em>. ‘Hoodlum’ it is,
and probably ever will be.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hoodman Blind.</b> The ancient form of the game of “Blind

Man had the hood, which everyone wore, drawn over

<p class='c010'><b>Hull, Hell, and Halifax.</b> In olden times, before Kingston-upon-Hull
could be approached direct from the
Humber, the River Hull was navigable, as now, only
at high water, and even then it required very skilful
pilotage on account of the many sandbanks at its
mouth; it was therefore dreaded by seafaring men.
Taylor, the Water Poet, wrote: “From Hull, Hell, and
Halifax, good Lord, deliver us!” The reference to
Halifax arose out of the knowledge that in his day a
man could be executed there for stealing property to
the value of thirteen pence halfpenny. See “<a href='#GIBBETLAW'>Halifax Gibbet Law</a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Humbug.</b> The old mode of expressing approbation of a
speech or at the play was by humming, but since the
sincerity of this form of applause could not always be
relied upon, intermingled as it may have been with
suppressed murmurs of disapproval, the word <em>Hum</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>came to be applied to mock admiration or flattery, intended
only to deceive. Hence the saying: “That’s
all hum.” The added word <em>Bug</em> is very old, signifying
a frightful object, a thing to be shunned. To humbug
is to deceive; to prefer candour to humbug is to be
proof against flattery.</p>

from Asia and expelled the Goths from this portion of
Europe in the fourth century. When first heard of in
China, about a hundred years previous, the natives

Huns were really the Mongolian race still known as

the battle cry of the Normans was <em>Ha-Rou</em>, in honour
of Rollo.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hurricane.</b> From the West Indian <em>urican</em>, “a violent
wind.” The word was introduced to Europe by seamen,
and so became incorporated in various languages.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hurry up.</b> An exclamation derived, both in England and
America, from the custom of eating-house keepers
anxious to expedite the service from the kitchens

When Matthias Corvinus ascended the throne of the
Magyars he decreed that, in order to provide a regular

mounted soldier free of all cost to the State. An
interesting point in connection with the uniform of
the Hussar regiments everywhere was that they
always allowed the right sleeve of the upper jacket to
hang loose on their backs. This was only in keeping
with the general custom of the Magyar peasantry, who
had the right arm free on all occasions.</p>

the Reformer.</p>

implies a slatternly sort of woman.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Hustings.</b> The ancient name for the Court of Aldermen
in the city of London. In modern days it came to

satirical pieces.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='IBERIA'></a><b>Iberia.</b> The ancient name of Spain, from the <em>Iberi</em>, its
original inhabitants. These were maritime adventurers
from Ph&oelig;nicia who penetrated the country by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>way of the River Ebro. When in course of time the
Celts descended upon them from the Pyrenees, they
spread themselves to the south and west. On reaching
the sea at the farthest limit of their wanderings
they imagined themselves at the end of the world, and
so gave the name of <em>Iber</em>, a Ph&oelig;nician word of that
import, to the country. Its principal eastern river, the
Ebro, retains the original name.</p>

account of its intrinsic worth, but because it is a
visible representation, or it may be merely a symbol,
of the deity that he is taught to venerate.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Idol Lane.</b> Said to be a corruption of Idle Lane, because
this was perhaps the only thoroughfare in the neighbourhood
not given up to business--<em>i.e.</em> either as a

of the Sanskrit <em>Sindhu</em>, “great river.” By the Greeks
this river was known as the <em>Hindus</em>, which with the
Persian suffix <em>stan</em> gave the name “Hindustan” to the

this state in the early days of its history.</p>

the “New World” he was under the impression that
he had happened on that vast tract of country east of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>the Ganges vaguely known as India. This shows
that, sailing westward as he did, he must have regarded
the earth as a globe.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Indian Summer.</b> The equivalent of what is called St
Martin’s Summer in England. The North American
Indians always avail themselves of the pleasant weather

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span><b>Infant Roscius.</b> William Henry Betty, the celebrated boy
actor, named after the greatest historian of antiquity.
His public career was brief--viz. five years only, 1803-1808--but
during that period he became the rage; so
much so, that while at Covent Garden, where he received
a salary of fifty guineas a night, the military
had to be called out to maintain order.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Infantry.</b> Foot soldiers, so called, not because, like
children, they have to be trained to walk, but for the
reason that one of the <em>Infantes</em> of Spain collected a
body of armed men, unmounted, to rescue his father,
the King, from captivity at the hands of the Moors.
Afterwards foot soldiers in Spain and Italy received
the name of <em>Enfanteria</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='INN'></a><b>Inn.</b> The Anglo-Saxon word <em>Inne</em> expressed a mansion.
The Inns of Court were originally the town houses of
noble families, whose name they still bear--<em>e.g.</em> Gray’s
Inn. Our first inns set apart for the entertainment
of travellers were in all cases the mansions of the
nobility left in charge of the trusted servant, the
gamekeeper, during the prolonged absence, either in
the wars at home or in the Crusades abroad, of their
owners. The family arms served as a sign. After
the return of his master the servant, now an innkeeper,
set up an inn of his own contiguous to the
original, and adopted the same sign. Here we have
an explanation of such grotesque inn signs--now that
their names have taken the place of the painted device--as
the Blue Boar, the Red Lion, etc. At times
the innkeeper preferred the sign of the “Green Man.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Innocents’ Day.</b> December 28th, commemorating the
massacre of the Holy Innocents by Herod. Anciently
children were soundly whipped in their beds before

<p class='c010'><a id='INQUAD'></a><b>In Quad.</b> This is not altogether thieves’ slang, though
the gipsy word for prison is <em>quaid</em>. Boys at our public
schools say they are “in quad” when they are confined
to their own quadrangle. The phrase became
popular in connection with a prison when debtors
were confined in the Fleet, the Marshalsea, and Whitecross
Street, because they were free to receive visitors
in the exercise court or quadrangle.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>In the wrong Box.</b> The origin of this expression is simply
this: When Vauxhall, Cremorne, Ranelagh, Highbury
Barn, and similar alfresco resorts were in existence,
they had rows of cosy hutches or boxes all around for
the benefit of those who wished to do their courting
in private, while they could at the same time listen to
the music and see the illuminations. It was no easy

the many if he left it; consequently on returning to
his partner after sallying forth, he rendered his presence
obnoxious to strangers by suddenly finding himself in
the wrong box.</p>

carry a bag made of goatskin.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Knave.</b> From the German <em>knabe</em>, a boy. The tricks

course, the knight or servant to the king and queen.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Knife-board.</b> The advertisement-board on either side of
an omnibus roof, so called on account of its fancied

his immortal romance “Don Quixote.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>La Belle Sauvage Yard.</b> The yard of the famous coaching
inn of the same name. The history of this sign
was curious. Kept by Isabelle Savage, it bore the
name of “The Bel Savage”; but its sign was a bell
suspended within an iron hoop at the top of the usual
“Ale Stake.” Hence its proper name was “The Bell
in the Hoop.” When in the year 1616 John Rolfe
brought his Virginian bride Pocohontas to London, the
story of his remarkable adventures had anticipated his
arrival, and people spoke of this Indian heroine as
“La Belle Sauvage.” It was odd that these strangers
within our gates should put up at the “Bell Savage,”
and the association resulted in the change of title
on their account.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Lascar.</b> The generic name for an East Indian seaman,
though it really expresses the Persian for a soldier,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>from <em>lashkari</em>, a camp-follower. Lascars were first

Nowadays all Asiatic sailors, of whatever nationality,

tents set apart for them even within sight of Jerusalem.
Historians tell us too that, though a religious Order,
the Templars did not scruple to introduce these

their suppression by Edward II. in 1313.</p>

or other celebrity, generally a foreigner, at whose
shrine society metaphorically worships while his fame

make the most of a “stranger within our gates.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Lo.</b> An American term for an Indian. This originated

The early settlers of Mexico and Texas gave the name
of <em>gallofo</em> to a vagrant, who, like the <em>lazzaroni</em> of Naples,
hung about the churches begging for alms. From the

<p class='c010'><b>Lock, Stock, and Barrel.</b> A sportsman’s phrase for the
whole of a thing, in allusion to the three parts of a

<p class='c010'><b>Loco-Focos.</b> The American term for lucifer matches. By
a patent dated 16th April 1834 John Marck, a storekeeper
of Park Row, New York, brought out a self-lighting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>or friction cigar, which he called a Loco-Foco.
The first portion of this name was taken from the
newly introduced locomotive, which people generally
thought to mean self-moving; the latter half was a
euphonism of his own. When friction or self-firing
matches came in they received the same designation.
The Democratic Party of the United States received
the name of “Loco-Focos” from the circumstance
that at a great general meeting held in Tammany Hall
to confirm the nomination of Gideon Lee as the
Democratic candidate for Congress, a tumult arose,
and the lights were turned out; whereupon the
adherents of the candidate, who had provided themselves
with loco-focos and candles, relighted the hall
in a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Loft.</b> An Americanism for storey. In the United States

cutting down trees and sawing them into logs.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='LOGGERHEAD'></a><b>Loggerhead.</b> A dull, stupid fellow with no more sense
in his head than a “logger” or lumberman. These
loggers often quarrel for no visible cause; hence the
expression to be “at loggerheads.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Log-rolling.</b> Primarily a political term descriptive of
mutual co-operation on the part of individuals for
the furtherance of a general cause. It means: “You
help me and I’ll help you”; “If your party further my
Bill through Congress I’ll pledge my party to push
yours along too.” The expression obtains also in a
social and journalistic sense: “If I propose a testimonial
for you I expect you to do the same for me”;
“I’ll write you up in the Press if you engage to
return the compliment.” For the origin of the term
we must look to the lumber regions of the state of
Maine, where the loggers of different camps assist one
another by turns to roll their logs down to the river.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Lollards.</b> Originally an association of pious people in
Germany at the commencement of the thirteenth century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>banded together for the purpose of burying the
dead. They were so called on account of the solemn
dirges they sang, from the Low German <em>lollen</em>, to sing
softly. After a time the same title was assumed by
the followers of one Walter Goilard, a dissolute priest,
who was burned for heresy at Cologne in 1322. The
Wycliffites assumed this name still later, and some
of these it must have been who were imprisoned in
the “Lollards’ Tower,” Lambeth Palace.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Lombard Street.</b> From the Jews of Lombardy, who here
set up banks and money-lending establishments, at the
instance of Pope Gregory IX., as a means of assisting
the people of England to raise money for the payment
of their taxes early in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Lombardy.</b> Called by the Romans <em>Longobardi</em> after its
people, whom they subdued. This name was not
derived from their long beards, as generally stated,
but from the <em>longis bardis</em>, or long battle-axes, with
which they were armed.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>London.</b> This name claims the same origin as “Lincoln,”
the first rude habitations beside the Thames being
situated on the rising ground now known as Tower
Hill.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>London Bridge was built on Woolpacks.</b> This expression
had its origin in the fact that, when the construction
of Old London Bridge was stopped for want of
funds, Henry II. expedited its completion by imposing
a tax upon wool.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Londonderry.</b> The town built by a company of London

a path across the fields between Lincoln’s Inn and

<p class='c010'><b>Ludgate Hill.</b> The testimony of Old Stow notwithstanding,
there is grave doubt whether King Lud, the reputed
builder of the western gate of the city, ever

There being no Court of Law for many miles around

decision, and his judgments were so sound and impartial
that the people gave him the name of Judge
Lynch. The death sentence was by hanging at the
nearest tree. To “lynch a man,” however, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>modern sense is to dispense with legal formalities

what appear to be supernatural powers, as the result of
the very highest intellectual development.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Mahogany.</b> A vulgar term very frequently heard in the
Midland counties for a man’s wife. This arose from
the fact that the wood of the Mahogany-tree (West
Indian <em>Mahogan</em>, but botanically <em>Swietenia Mahogani</em>)
was for many years at first used exclusively for the
manufacture of domestic dining-tables; hence a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>man would say: “I’ll discuss it with my wife over the
Mahogany.” Eventually the phrase was corrupted
into “I’ll talk to the Mahogany about it,” and so the

<p class='c010'><b>Mahrattas.</b> The Hindoo term for “outcasts.” Although

This thoroughfare had at its western corner a
statue of “Our Lady” let into the wall.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='MAIDMARIAN'></a><b>Maid Marian.</b> So far from having any connection with
Robin Hood and his merry men in Sherwood Forest,
this term is derived from the “Morris Dance,” in
which five men and a boy took part. On account of
his antics and the ill-fitting <em>morione</em>, or helmet, that
this boy wore, he came to be styled as the “Mad
Morion,” of which Maid Marian was an easy corruption.</p>

was regarded by our ancestors as a fighting man. Since
the introduction of ironclads, however, it has become
the custom to speak of a floating battery as a war
vessel or battleship, and a sailor as a bluejacket.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Nightcap.</b> Since everyone in the days of our grandfathers
wore a nightcap, and fancied he could not

<p class='c010'><b>Nimrod.</b> Charles James Apperley, the sporting contributor

of the south bank of the Thames.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Nine Tailors make a Man.</b> The second word in this

was in olden times a stroke of the “passing bell” of
the parish church. Three tellers gave warning of the
death of a child, six of a woman, and nine of a man.
As the parishioners counted the strokes they would
say: “Nine tellers make a man.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span><b>Ninny.</b> Short for “Nincompoop.” In America this term

is therefore the easier plan.</p>

pick purses and pockets, and nip off unobserved;
hence the expression “A Young Nipper.”</p>

North, who amassed a fortune by the nitrate industry

Shepherd, also figured in those dialogues, he was not
present at the meetings.</p>

England who refused to subscribe or conform to the

<p class='c010'><b>No Quarter.</b> When the battle cry of “No Quarter,”
consequent on an order, goes forth, no lives are spared

warfare, when, by way of earning prize-money, a soldier
refrained from dealing the death blow to a fallen foe
on condition of receiving a quarter of the latter’s pay.</p>

the east coast settled by the Angles, the north folk
and south folk respectively.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Norfolk Howards.</b> An excess of refinement has caused

in the action of Joshua Bugg of the Swan Tavern,
Norwich, who by deed poll, as advertised in <em>The Times</em>
26th June 1862, changed his name to Norfolk
Howard. In America all beetles are commonly
styled bugs.</p>

expressive of the fine barred gate leading from Bishopsgate
without the city limits into the open fields.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Norway.</b> Called in the native tongue <em>Nordrike</em>, “the
north kingdom.” This country was long thought to be
wholly surrounded by water, on which account it received
the name of <em>Nordee</em>, “north island.” This the
Saxons modified in <em>Norea</em>, and later Norway.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Norwich.</b> So called from the castle erected by the East

<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>of Drury Lane Theatre, and John Wilson, the painter,
both of whom had exceptionally long noses. The
Duke of Wellington was also popularly referred to
under this name by his soldiers on account of his
Roman nose.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Nothing succeeds like Success.</b> When a man is successful
the world bows before him. Each fresh enterprise
is crowned with success, because there is an abiding
public faith in the man who has made money or hit
the popular taste. His intrinsic merits may be no
greater than those of the poor devil who has systematically
failed; yet what he lacks himself he readily
finds in his subordinates, whom he can afford to pay,
while the credit is all his own.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Notions.</b> An Americanism for small wares or trifles in

<p class='c010'><b>Nottingham.</b> Called by the Anglo-Saxons <em>Snottengaham</em>,

little doubt exists that the Britons made their habitations
in the caverns with which this county abounds.</p>

of Portland, the great ground landlord. A goodly
portion of Sherwood Forest is included in this ducal

<p class='c010'><b>Not worth a Rap.</b> A rap was an Irish copper coin
issued early in the eighteenth century to supply a long-felt
need for very small money. Nominally worth a
halfpenny, its metal was so thin and base that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>never passed for more than a farthing. Its infinitesimal
value consequently gave rise to this expression.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Not worth a Song.</b> A song is worth nothing at all after
its popularity has waned. The good old songs live on
account of their intrinsic merits, but they were not
pushed into public favour by adventitious methods at
the time of publication. Those of our day are ground
out of street pianos and sung everywhere for a brief
season, then heard no more.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Nova Scotia.</b> This name, expressive of “New Scotland,”

fruit; hence the name given to a cordial flavoured
with the kernel of the bitter almond or peach stone.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Nun.</b> From the Italian <em>nonna</em>, a grandmother. Those
who retired into convents originally were aged women.
It was only in modern times that seminaries for girls
were established in convents; this opened the way to
maidens becoming deeply imbued with religious ideas
and secluding themselves from the world by taking the
veil.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Nunhead.</b> From a tea garden and holiday resort known
to Londoners as “The Nun’s Head” ever since the

(29th May), when people formerly wore oak leaves or
oak apples in their hats to commemorate the manner
in which the partisans of Charles II. welcomed his

course, in allusion to his concealment in an oak-tree
near Boscobel House, Shropshire, after the battle of
Worcester, on 3rd September previous.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Oakley Square.</b> After Oakley House, near Bedford, one
of the country seats of the Duke of Bedford, the
ground landlord.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Oaks Stakes.</b> So called from a Lodge or Club-House

<p class='c010'><b>Odder.</b> Colloquial for one who obtains a livelihood by
doing odd jobs.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Oddfellows.</b> This friendly society originated with five
Manchester shoemakers who in 1812 were accustomed
to meet after the day’s work. It having occurred to
one of them how his family would fare if, through
sickness, he should be unable to follow his occupation,
and thinking it would be wise to make some provision
against such a contingency, he proposed that each of
them should subscribe a few pence weekly towards a
common sick fund. The idea was at once taken up.
They called themselves Oddfellows because they numbered
five. Others soon joined the little society, and
from these humble beginnings it grew into a powerful
organisation.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Odd rot it.</b> A perversion of the Crusaders’ curse: “God
rot them!” meaning the Saracens, the enemies of
Christianity.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Odds Bodkins.</b> A perversion of “God’s Body,” in
allusion to the Eucharist. This oath was not considered

Maypole stored away in Shaft Alley, Leadenhall Street,
and perhaps other Maypoles elsewhere of post-Reformation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>days. As long as it rested “on the hooks” there
was a likelihood of its being once more called into
service. See “<a href='#UNDERSHAFT'>St Andrew Undershaft</a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ohio.</b> Indian for “beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>O.K.</b> This arose out of an Irishman’s endorsement for
goods passed by him, as he would have spelt out the
words “Orl Korrect.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Old Bags.</b> The nickname of Lord Eldon, because he
always carried about with him, in separate brief bags,
the cases on which he had to pass judgment.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Old Bailey.</b> From the Latin <em>ballium</em>, a rampart, through
the French <em>baille</em>. The term “Bailey” expressed the
open space or court between a castle and the embattlements.
Seeing that Lud Gate stood in line with
this street at its southern extremity, there must have
been a keep or fortification behind the Roman Wall
where the Sessions House came to be built. The name
was therefore retained after the wall was demolished.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='OLDHICKORY'></a><b>Old Hickory.</b> “Hickory” is an Americanism used adjectively
for anyone who is tough, obstinate, or hard,
after the tree of the same name. General Andrew
Jackson merited the nickname of “Old Hickory” from
his own soldiers on account of his tough, unyielding
disposition. Its origin is thus explained by Parton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>the author of the President’s “Life”: “The name of
‘Old Hickory’ was not an instantaneous inspiration,
but a growth. First of all, the remark was made by
some soldier, who was struck with his commander’s
pedestrian powers, that the General was tough. Next
it was observed that he was as tough as hickory. Then
he was called ‘Hickory.’ Lastly, the affectionate
‘Old’ was prefixed, and the General thenceforth
rejoiced in the completed nickname, usually the first-won
honour of a great commander.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Old Lady of Threadneedle Street.</b> The popular name of
the Bank of England. There is a tradition that towards

was generally assumed that this old lady of Threadneedle
Street must have been waiting for someone who had
passed into the Bank, and, according to her idea,
never came out again. When, therefore, in 1797 the
Bank threatened a temporary stoppage of payment, and

published a caricature entitled “The Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street in Danger.” Since that time the
Bank has been colloquially referred to by this title.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Peter’s Pence.</b> An annual contribution throughout the
Roman Catholic world for the upkeep of the vast

<p class='c010'><b>Philistines.</b> The inhabitants of ancient Philistia, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“Palestine.” Because these were continually at war
with the Jews, the term has been applied by university
students to the citizens generally, and to the
preservers of law and order more particularly. “A
battle with the Philistines” is but another name for

for the sale of “piccadilly lace,” having <em>pica</em>, or spearlike

the diminutive. So fashionable was this lace during
the time of Elizabeth that when in the succeeding
reign of James I. the high ruff came into vogue, it
bore the name of a <em>piccadilly</em>, though shorn of its lace
edging. “Piccadilla Hall” must have stood somewhere

<em>picti</em>, or painted men, because, they stained their skins
with woad.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pie Corner.</b> It has been considered curious that the
Great Fire of London should have broken out in
“Pudding Lane” and ended at Pie Corner. Scarcely

“Magpie.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pierrot.</b> French for “Little Peter.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pig and Whistle.</b> A tavern sign corrupted from “Piggen
Wassail.” Piggen expressed the Anglo-Saxon for a
milking pail, of which <em>pig</em> was the diminutive. When
a large party frequented the alehouse the liquor was
set before them in a <em>piggen</em>, each helping himself from

“<a href='#HAIL'>Hail</a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pigeon English.</b> That employed by the Chinese in their
commercial relations with Europeans. The word
<em>pigeon</em> is a native corruption of “business,” which it
seems impossible for a Chinaman to pronounce

Ports.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pig in a Poke.</b> See “<a href='#BUYAPIG'>Buy a Pig in a Poke</a>” and “<a href='#CATOUTOFBAG'>Let the Cat out of the Bag</a>.”</p>

account of their shaven heads and braided pigtails.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pikes.</b> The name given in California to the poor southern

<p class='c010'><b>Pimlico.</b> This was originally a district of tea gardens for
holiday folk, with a <em>specialité</em> for nut-brown ales. It
received its name from Ben Pimlico, the owner of a
noted resort in Hoxton on the site of what is now the
Britannia Theatre. The nut-brown ale was first
popularised by this worthy, who could not have regarded
the application of his name to ales purveyed
elsewhere with much favour. From “Pimlico Ales,”
the neighbourhood itself soon came to be known as
Pimlico.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Pimlico Walk.</b> It is hard to believe that this was once a
regular holiday promenade for the citizens of London.
On Sundays and on week-day evenings it was thronged,
skirting as it did the famous tea gardens of Ben
Pimlico, in whose retired arbours courting couples
softly murmured “sweet nothings.” This resort was to
Londoners of a bygone day what Rosherville is in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>own time. From a tea garden it developed into what
was styled a “saloon,” and eventually into a regular
theatre.</p>

was discovered in the following manner:--One day a
favourite dog of Hercules of Tyre ate a species of fish
known to the ancients by the name of <em>purpura</em>, and
on returning to his master his lips were found to be
tinged with the colour, which, after a few experiments,
Hercules successfully imitated.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='PURSESTRINGS'></a><b>Purse Strings.</b> In the days of our grandfathers, when hasp

<p class='c010'><a id='RAGGING'></a><b>Ragging.</b> In military parlance this word expresses the
system of persecution by which an unpopular man
suffers indignities at the hands of his comrades. It
has the same meaning as the North Country “Rag,”
to enrage or make angry, and “Bullyrag,” to administer
a severe scolding. The latter, however, of which the
former is an abbreviation, has not been derived from
the Dutch <em>bulderen</em>, to scold or bully, as is generally
supposed, but from the custom of the Spanish bullfighters
of waving a red cloak in front of the bull in
order to excite him to fury. This is the <em>rag</em> referred
to. The corresponding United States term for
“ragging” is “Hazing.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Rag Money.</b> American slang for paper money.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Rag Time.</b> An Americanism for a dancing frolic of the
“go-as-you-please” order, in which musical time and
rhythm are, as it were, torn into shreds; a ragged, loose,
disconnected, unconventional time. The term has
been well explained by an authoritative writer in <em>The
Referee</em> as follows:--“Rag time is the outcome of
‘Rag Speech,’ a speech that casts tradition, balance,
beauty, elegance, and refinement to the winds, and
that believes that more effect can be made by punching
certain syllables into the brain of the listener.
Technically speaking, ‘Rag Time’ shifts the strong
accent from the first to the second beat of the bar.
Against this there is a cross-rhythm with a kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>halting contrapuntal ornamentation in the accompaniment,
which sometimes brings a stress on to the fourth
beat of the bar. The result of this irregularity and
false quantity is to destroy the rhythm to an extent that
often makes it difficult to say whether the music is in
duple or triple measure. The musical consequence is
the breaking down of symmetrical form, and the
tendency is to reduce the organised structure to its
component parts.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Railroad City.</b> Indianapolis, a junction of the great trunk
lines.</p>

two distinct sources--popular superstition and

of transforming themselves into cats at will, while the
dog or wolf is represented as the attendant of Odin,
the Storm King of the northern nations.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Rainy Day Smith.</b> John Thomas Smith, the antiquary,
whose chatty volume, “A Book for a Rainy Day,”
brought him more money and reputation than all his
other works put together.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='RAISEYOURSCREW'></a><b>Raise your Screw.</b> This expression arose out of the
custom of masters paying their employées’ wages
screwed up in a tiny paper of uniform size. The
more money it contained the less tightly the paper
could be screwed; hence an advance of wages implied
metaphorically giving the screw one turn backwards.</p>

to seize the stakes.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Ram and Teazle.</b> A tavern sign common to the woollen

where they found lodgings and entertainment of a low
class in days prior to the provision of “Seamen’s
Homes,” received its name from the multitudes of
water rats that congregated on the Thames wall by
night. On account of the evil reputation which this
neighbourhood bore in former days, its name was
changed to “St George’s in the East.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Rathbone Place.</b> After Captain Rathbone, its builder,
in 1718.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='RATHOLE'></a><b>Rat Hole.</b> A printers’ term for a non-society house.
Since rats are known to desert a sinking ship, so a
journeyman who refuses to take advantage of a trades
union is stigmatised as a “Rat,” because he forsakes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the general cause of his craft. Hence also the term
“Rattening,” by which is meant the taking away of or
destroying a workman’s tools consequent upon his
desertion of the union or accepting work in a house
opposed to its principles.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Rationalism.</b> The kind of religion (if it deserved such
a name) set up during the French Revolution, when
Reason took the place of Faith. The worship of the
“Goddess of Reason,” in the person of an actress
installed in the Cathedral of Notre Dame, was a fitting
illustration of the unreasoning tenet that public worship
was opposed to the natural instincts of mankind.</p>

of Rechab, who lived in tents and abstained from the
use of wine.</p>

the cost is often greater than the traveller anticipates;
therefore it is always wise to be well prepared with
funds, lest, when the host presents his bill, discomfiture
may arise.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Recluse.</b> From the Latin <em>reclusus</em>, shut up; one who

Day.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>St Petersburg.</b> Founded by Peter the Great, and dedicated
to St Peter, whose church is situated within the
citadel.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>St Sepulchre’s.</b> The foundation of this church was the
outcome of the Crusades, in honour of the Holy
Sepulchre at Jerusalem. Appropriately enough, the
bell of the modern edifice gave warning to the unhappy
inmates of the condemned cell in Newgate
Prison over the way of their approaching last hour.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>St Sophia.</b> This beautiful mosque at Constantinople,
although originally a Christian cathedral, so far from
having been dedicated to any St Sophia, was called
<em>Hagia Sopia</em>, “Holy Wisdom”--<em>i.e.</em> the eternal wisdom
of <em>God</em> manifested in the Second Person of the Trinity.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>St Stephen’s.</b> The House of Commons bears this name
because, in the absence of a separate building, its
members held their sittings in the Chapel of St
Stephen’s, Westminster Abbey, until that edifice was
burned down, 16th October 1834.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span><b>St Swithin’s Day.</b> The day of the attempted reinterment
(15th July) of the body of St Swithin, preceptor of
King Ethelwulf and Bishop of Rochester, whose death
took place 2nd July 862. Not regarding himself
worthy to be “laid” within the sacred edifice, he
requested that he might be buried just outside the
door in the churchyard, so that the faithful would
walk over his grave. Although they acceded to this
last wish, the monks decided afterwards to lay him
inside the church; but their design was frustrated for
forty successive days by a pouring rain, until at last
they desisted from the attempt. This circumstance
gave rise to the saying that “If it rains on St Swithin’s
day it will rain for forty days.”</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='VALENTINES'></a><b>St Valentine’s Day.</b> The connection between St Valentine
and the poetical epistles that were formerly interchanged
between young lovers on the 14th of February
is somewhat remote. On this day the good Christian
Bishop was beheaded at Rome in the year 278. Long
before this, however, Roman youths and maidens had
followed the custom of selecting a lover for the year
by shaking up the names of their favourites, written
on separate tablets, in a box. This arose out of the
old notion that birds begin to pair on the 14th of
February. The martyrdom of Bishop Valentine on
this day therefore actuated the Christians to style
their selected lover their Valentine, and the presents
they exchanged in modern times bore the same name.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Salic Law.</b> The ancient Frankish law by which females
were excluded from the throne. This was originally
confined to what were called “Salic Lands,” either, as
some say, from the <em>salle</em>, or hall of the owner, or,
according to others, from the Salian Franks, those
bordering on the Sale or Yssel River; the enactment
eventually applied to the heritage of the Frankish
kingdom.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Salisbury Square.</b> This, like the street and court of the
same name, marks the site of the town mansion and
grounds of the bishops of Salisbury.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Samaria.</b> After Shemer, the owner of the hill which, as
we are told in 1 Kings xvi. 24, Omri bought for two

name of the city which he built, after the name of
Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sandbaggers.</b> A modern street terror in American cities

<p class='c010'><b>Sandhillers.</b> A name given in America to the descendants
of the white labourers, who, ousted from their employment
when slavery came in, sought the sand-hills amid
the pine forests of Georgia and South Carolina.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='SANDOWGIRL'></a><b>Sandow Girl.</b> A physical culture girl trained at the Academy
of Eugene Sandow, or at home by means of appliances
advertised in connection therewith. Also known
as the “Symmetrion Girl” from the name on the
familiar posters. The Sandow or Symmetrion Girls
proved a great attraction in the Athletic Scene of <em>The
Dairymaids</em> at the Apollo Theatre.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sandwich.</b> The sand village.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sandwiches.</b> After John Montague, Earl of Sandwich,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>whose chief claim to celebrity lay in the fact that he
was an inveterate gamester. It is on record that he
often remained engrossed in play for thirty hours at a
stretch without partaking of a meal. From time to
time, however, he would ask the waiter to bring him
a slice of meat between two pieces of bread, as a stay
to the appetite. The waiter called this improvised
meal a “Sandwich,” and by that name it has ever
since been known.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sandwich Islands.</b> Named by Captain Cook in honour of
Lord Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty, at the
time when they were discovered by him.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sandy.</b> The nickname of a Scotsman, being short for
Alexander, the most common Christian name to be
met with in North Britain.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>San Francisco.</b> Dedicated to St Francis, this Spanish-American

settlement of missionaries styled “San Francisco de
Costa Dolores” as far back as September 1776.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sankey’s Horse.</b> The regimental nickname of the 39th
Foot. This was merited in India, when they were
called upon to do temporary service on horseback
under Colonel Sankey.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sansculottes.</b> The lowest orders of the people during the
French Revolution. This, literally “without breeches,”
was the scornful title at first bestowed by the aristocrats
upon the Democratic party on account of their neglectful
attire. A little while later the Red Republicans
accepted it with pride as the password for patriotism.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>San Salvador.</b> This being the first land sighted in the
New World by Columbus, he honoured it with the name
of the “Holy Saviour,” as a perpetual expression of
thanksgiving.</p>

Mohammedans generally. See “<a href='#MOORS'>Moors</a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Saracen’s Head.</b> An inn sign of the time of the Crusades.
Lest it might be thought that this was complimentary
to the enemies of Christianity, mention may be made
of the fact that the head of the Saracen was represented
as severed.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Saragossa.</b> A corruption of the Roman name <em>Cæsarea
Augusta</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Saratoga.</b> Indian for “miraculous waters from the rock,”
touching the famous mineral springs.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Saratoga Trunk.</b> The popular type of travelling trunk in
the United States, so called because it was first used
by visitors to Saratoga Springs.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sarcophagus.</b> A Greek compound of <em>sarkos</em>, flesh, and
<em>phargo</em>, to eat. The term was originally applied to a
receptacle for the dead, because the early examples
were made out of a kind of limestone which was
thought to possess the property of consuming a corpse
in a very short time.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sardines.</b> From Sardinia, in the waters of which island
the true species of this fish abound.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='SARDINIA'></a><b>Sardinia.</b> Called <em>Sandaliotis</em> by the Greeks on account of
its resemblance to a human footprint; this name was
changed by the Romans to <em>Sardo</em>. At a later period
the island was called <em>Sardonion</em>, from a poisonous
herb, transplanted from Sardis in Asia Minor, which
brought about a twitching of the muscles of the face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>resembling laughter; hence the phrase to “Smile
sardonically.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Sardinia Street.</b> From the Sardinian Chapel built in 1648

Ambassador at the time when the island of Sardinia

<p class='c010'><b>Sarsenet.</b> A fine silk originally of Saracenic manufacture.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Saturday.</b> This, the seventh day of the week, was dedicated
by the Romans to Saturn. As, however, all the
other week-days were named by the people of Northern
Europe in accordance with Scandinavian mythology,
one must incline to the opinion that this was named
after Sæter, a water deity. Its Anglo-Saxon designation
was <em>Sæterdæg</em>.</p>

honour of Saturn, the god of agriculture.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span><b>Sawney.</b> A variant of “Sandy.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Saxons.</b> From the <em>seax</em>, the short crooked knife with

<p class='c010'><b>S’Blood.</b> A trooper’s corruption of “His Blood,” or the
precious blood of the Redeemer. This species of profanity

the good deeds of a soul after death would be weighed
against his evil deeds. The Koran likewise teaches

balanced in the scales of the Archangel Gabriel;
hence the phrase now popular all the civilised world
over.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Scalper.</b> An Americanism for one who speculates in railroad
tickets, and consequently obtains them at a
reduction of their top prices.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='SCAVENGERSDAUGHTER'></a><b>Scavenger’s Daughter.</b> A corruption of Skevington’s
Daughter, this instrument of torture being the invention
of William Skevington, Lieutenant of the

example was launched: “Look, she schoons!”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Schottische.</b> Expresses the German for a Scottish dance,
a variation of the polka, in three-quarter time. The
Scots, however, repudiate its invention. It is not
improbable that a Scotsman, sojourning in the Fatherland,
blundered into this step through his inability to
dance the polka correctly.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Scilly Isles.</b> After the name of one of the smallest, in
proximity to a very dangerous rock similar to that of
Scylla in Sicily which, according to Homer, was the

of its flights opens and shuts its tail for the purpose of
entrapping the flies that constitute its prey.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Scorching.</b> A bicycling term which, curiously enough, only
came into vogue after the possibility of realising it
had been removed. In the days of the old “Bone-shaker,”
before rubber tyres were heard of, there would
have been great likelihood of setting the wooden
machine on fire by furious riding on the part of an
expert.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Scotch Reel.</b> See “<a href='#REEL'>Reel</a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Scot-free.</b> A phrase derived from the old legal exaction
“Scot and Lot,” the former being derived from the

<p class='c010'><b>Sent to Coventry.</b> As its name implies, Coventry was in
olden times a great centre of religious life, touching
the number of its conventual establishments. Soldiers
sent to the garrison there soon discovered that no
woman would speak to them. Hence to be sent to
Coventry was a great hardship, since it meant being
cut off from “life” in every form, and female intercourse
particularly.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Set her Cap at him.</b> With the coquetry peculiar to her

<p class='c010'><b>Set the Thames on fire.</b> A “temse” was the old name
for a sieve, agreeably to the French <em>tamis</em> and the
Italian <em>tamiso</em>, which terms express the same implement.

often said to him touching his apparent laziness:
“You’ll never set the temse on fire!” Its punning</p>
<p class='c010'><b>Seven Dials.</b> A once notorious thieves’ neighbourhood,
which received its name from a stone column presenting
seven dials or faces, from which the same number
of streets radiated. This, originally set up to mark the
limits of St Giles’s and St Martin’s parishes, was
removed in 1763, owing to the erroneous idea that
a large sum of money lay buried beneath it.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='SEVENSISTERS'></a><b>Seven Sisters’ Road.</b> This long road, extending from
Holloway to Tottenham, received its name from seven

and foreigners. At this time Joseph Bonaparte was
nominally King of Naples and of Spain.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Stationer.</b> This term was not derived from “Stationery,”

stationery booksellers had a more varied assortment

received the name of “stationery,” and their vendors
that of “stationers.”</p>

having to “tally” or agree with the entries in his
book. Why such a one should be ashamed of his old-time
designation, and now style himself a “Credit
Draper,” can only be explained on the ground that the
tallyman is in bad odour with the husbands of the
guileless women whom he systematically overcharges.

but it degenerated into a political club. By way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>accounting for the designation, it may be added that
Tammany or Tammenund was the name of a famous
Indian chief of the Delaware tribe, greatly beloved by
his people.</p>

bluejackets proved themselves as good fighting men
on land as at sea, the Marines were an indispensable
adjunct to the Navy, but as time hung heavily upon
their hands they were always ready to listen to a story.
Finding that they were easily gullible, the sailors loved
to entertain them with the most extraordinary yarns,
and, while on shore, if they heard a wonderful story
themselves they made up their minds to “tell that to
the Marines.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Temple.</b> The seat of the “Knights Templars” in this country

<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>the Latin (?) <em>Thamesis</em>, “the broad Isis,” or that it

is ridiculous. The word is wholly Celtic, from <em>tam</em>,
smooth, and <em>esis</em>, one of the many variants of the
original <em>uisg</em>, water. It is quite true that that portion
of our noble river which flows past Oxford is called

<p class='c010'><b>Twickenham.</b> When Pope resided in this pretty up-river
village its name was “Twitnam” for short, but it
meant the same as of yore, a hamlet located between
two rivulets of the Thames. The word is Anglo-Saxon,
cognate with the modern German <em>zwischen</em>,
between, and <em>heim</em>, a home.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Twill.</b> From the German <em>zwillich</em>, “trellis work,” so

<p class='c010'><b>Uisquebaugh.</b> From <em>uisge</em>, water, and <em>beatha</em>, life, the

to England from beyond the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Umber.</b> From Umbria in Italy, where this pigment was
first obtained.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Umbrella.</b> From the Latin <em>umbra</em>, a shade. The
original function of such an article was to act as a
shelter against the scorching rays of the sun, similar
to those monster white or coloured umbrellas one
sees in a Continental market-place. It was Jonas
Hanway who first diverted it from its proper use.
See “<a href='#HANWAYSTREET'>Hanway Street</a>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='UNCLE'></a><b>Uncle.</b> How this name came to be applied to a pawnbroker
was as follows:--Before the “spout” was
introduced all those pledges which consisted of
clothing were attached to a very large book, or <em>uncus</em>
as it was called, conformably to the Latin description
of the article, since the Lombards were the earliest
pawnbrokers of history. When this <em>uncus</em> could
accommodate nothing more, the rope from which it
depended was unslung from the ceiling, and laid
across the shoulders of an assistant, who then carried
the whole collection to the store-rooms overhead.
Hence an article which had been pledged was said to
have “Gone to the Uncus,” or, as the modern phrase
has it, “Gone to my Uncle’s.”</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Uncle Sam.</b> The national nickname of the United States.
This arose out of the initials “U.S.,” which the
Government caused to be painted or branded on all
its stores just as the Government property in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>country is marked with a broad arrow. Since it
happened that the official whose duty it was to see
this marking properly carried out was known among
his numerous acquaintance as “Uncle Sam,” the general
impression obtained that the letters really applied to
him, as evidence that the goods had passed through
his hands. In this way “Uncle Sam” bequeathed
his name to a great nation.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Uncle Sam’s Ice-box.</b> Alaska, so called on account of
its northern situation. Prior to the year 1867 this
territory belonged to Russia.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Unionists.</b> Those who are opposed to Home Rule for

<p class='c010'><a id='UNIONJACK'></a><b>Union Jack.</b> The first part of this name has, of course,
reference to the Union of England and Scotland in
the person of James I., but the application of the
word “Jack” to our national flag is not so easily
disposed of. Nevertheless, reference to our note on
“Jack-boots” will afford the reader a key to the
question. Twenty-six of such “Jacques,” emblazoned
with the arms of St George, were ordered by Edward
III. for one of his warships. Designed primarily for
the defence of his soldiers when in fighting array,
they were placed in a row along the low bulwarks
while the vessel was sailing, just as the Romans and
the hardy Norsemen disposed of their shields at sea.
After this statement it should not be difficult to see
how the Cross of St George displayed on a <em>jacque</em>
lent its name at first to the staff from which the
English flag was flown, and later to the flag itself.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span><b>Unitarians.</b> Those who are opposed to the doctrine of

<p class='c010'><b>Up the Spout.</b> This expression requires no elucidating.
Nevertheless, there was a time when a pawnbroking
establishment had not the convenience of a “spout,”
and because this was so, the matter-of-fact tradesman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>earned for himself the endearing title of “My Uncle.”
See “<a href='#UNCLE'>Uncle</a>.”</p>

The Vaudeville Theatre in the Strand was built for
entertainments of this class.</p>

<p class='c010'><b>Vauxhall.</b> After Jane Vaux, the occupant of the manor
house in 1615. This name, however, would seem to

have been in those far-off days described as
“Fulkes Hall.”</p>

too well; he burned twenty-one French coasting

<p class='c010'><b>Wicked Bible.</b> Wilfully or otherwise the word “not” is

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
